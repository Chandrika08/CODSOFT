CODSOFT: Machine Learning Internship Tasks

Welcome to my Machine Learning Internship Portfolio! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. Below is a summary of the projects:

Task_1. MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION

Description: Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

Task_2. CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION

Description: Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription- based service or business. Use historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.

Task_3. SPAM SMS DETECTION

Description: Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages.
